# CT3Tweaks
A GUI (and command-line) tool for modifying Crazy Taxi 3 to support
custom resolutions, higher framerate and higher field of view.

## Roadmap
### 1.0
* ✔ Finalize library
* ✔ Command-line functionality
* ❌ Graphical interface

## Texture/asset modification
I am planning on implementing asset modding into CT3Tweaks, however
there is quite a bit of research that needs to be done beforehand.
If you perhaps know a thing or two about reverse engineering texture
formats, [check out my post on Reverse Engineering][1] where I've
compiled everything I know about the format CT3 uses. Reply on that
post or [join my Discord][Discord] if you wish to discuss and share
your knowledge. Thank you!
